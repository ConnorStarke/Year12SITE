     Ores are primarily collected for crafting purposes, such as for tools and armor. Redstone is obtained from redstone ore, which can be used to create redstone circuits. Ore can also be combined to create a block of the material's type.


This graph shows the actual amount of ores found in a relatively small but untapped world as of Java Edition 1.12.2

Obtaining resources from ores is as simple as mining them (this is not the case for iron, ancient debris, and gold ores, which must be smelted). Coal, diamond, emerald, and nether quartz ores drop 1 unit corresponding raw materials. Redstone ore drops 4-5 redstone dust, and lapis lazuli ore drops 4-9 lapis lazuli. Note this can be increased greatly with Fortune. All ore blocks except iron, ancient debris and gold require a Silk Touch pickaxe to drop themselves.
