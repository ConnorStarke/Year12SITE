     o access the Nether, the player must construct a nether portal in the Overworld (portals created in The End do not activate). To create the portal, the player must first build a rectangular obsidian frame, ranging in size from a minimum of 4×5 to a maximum of 23×23. Once the frame is built, it can then be activated by placing fire within the frame, using flint and steel, fire charge, dispensers or any materials. An activated portal allows most entities (with the exception of the wither, the ender dragon, and entities riding or being ridden by another entity) to be transported to a corresponding portal in the Nether. In Survival, the player must stand in a nether portal for 4 seconds to get to the Nether. The player can step out of a portal before it completes its animation to abort the teleport. The portal generates a sound effect while the player is inside it. If there is no corresponding portal, a new 4×5 portal is created. The portal can be destroyed by breaking the obsidian frame, by a nearby explosion, or by placing water or lava into it with a bucket or dispenser. Any of the blocks in the corners can be destroyed without destroying the portal. In the Old world type, it is impossible to construct a Nether portal. The portal block must be placed using cheats.‌[Bedrock Edition only] When done, the nether has the same 256×256 borders as the overworld, and if a nether portal is then made in the nether, it can spawn the player outside the world barrier.
