     Pressing use on an adult villager or wandering trader opens a GUI, allowing a player to trade with the villager or wandering trader. Villagers make offers based on their profession trading either emeralds for items or items for emeralds. Wandering traders offer only to sell items for emeralds. All transactions involve emeralds.

A villager offers to buy or sell items pertinent to the villager's career. Trading with a villager is also the only legitimate method of acquiring the globe banner patternâ€Œ[JE only] and woodland and ocean explorer maps in Survival mode.

Different professions are assigned to each villager based on their job-site block. This profession is indicated by their appearance and in the trading interface. A villager's profession dictates the trading pool used to determine its trades. For example, villagers wearing straw hats are farmers, so their trades are based on the Farmer trade pool.
