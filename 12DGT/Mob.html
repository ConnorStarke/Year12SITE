     Mobs come to exist by spawning in various ways. Most mobs spawn naturally, dependent on the light level, biome, and their surroundings, oftentimes in groups with mobs of the same variety. However, passive mobs spawn much less often than hostile mobs.â€Œ[Java Edition only] These mobs usually spawn in upon initial chunk creation. Most passive mobs also have the ability to breed, spawning baby versions of themselves. Mobs do not naturally spawn on transparent blocks, in water (except for squid, drowned, fish, dolphin, guardians, and elder guardians), in lava (except for striders), on bedrock, or on blocks less than a full block tall (such as slabs placed on the bottom half). The exception is monster spawners, from which they can spawn naturally on any block including air.

Some mobs (like the snow golem, and the wither) require that the player "construct" them before being able to spawn. The iron golem can spawn naturally and can also be constructed. The ender dragon can be respawned with 4 end crystals.

Players can also spawn mobs by using spawn eggs in Creative mode, or the /summon command after enabling cheats. However, if the player tries to summon an ender dragon with the /summon command and doesn't set the DragonPhase tag, the dragon cannot move or attack.
